# Singletons

What is a singleton? A singleton is a class that can only be instantiated once. In Kotlin, we can create a singleton by using the `object` keyword.

```kotlin
object Singleton {
    fun doSomething() {
        println("Doing something!")
    }
}
```

We can then call the `doSomething()` method like this:

```kotlin
Singleton.doSomething()
```

Notice how we didn't have to create an instance of the class. We can just call the method directly on the class name.

## Why use singletons?

Singletons are useful when you want to create a class that can only be instantiated once. For example, if you have a class that connects to a database, you might want to make it a singleton so that you can only have one connection to the database at a time.
