# Extension Functions

In Kotlin, you can add new functions to existing classes without modifying their source code. This is done using extension functions.

## What is an extension function?

An extension function is a function that can be added to an existing class without modifying its source code. This is useful when you want to add functionality to a class that you don't have access to, such as a class from a library.

## How do I create an extension function?

Creating an extension function is easy, you simply do *ClassName*.functionName() and then define the function. Here's an example:

```kotlin
fun String.addExclamation() : String {
    return "$this!"
}
```

We can then call the `addExclamation()` method like this:

```kotlin
val myString = "Hello"
println(myString.addExclamation()) // prints "Hello!"
```

Notice how we didn't have to modify the `String` class to add the `addExclamation()` method.

## Why use extension functions?

Extension functions are very useful for adding functionality to classes that you don't have access to.
Things like double rounding or string manipulation can be added to the existing classes without modifying their source code.
