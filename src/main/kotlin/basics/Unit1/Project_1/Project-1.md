# Unit 1 Project

To finish off Unit 1, you will be creating a simple project that will test your knowledge of the concepts you learned in this unit.

It is up to you what you would like to create (as long as you clear it with a software lead), but here are some ideas:

- A simple calculator
    - Exactly as it sounds, reads in two numbers and an operator and prints the result
- Word Frequency Counter
    - Reads in a string and prints out the frequency of each word
- Student Grade Calculator
    - Reads in a list of grades and prints out the average, highest, and lowest grades

Some of these may require you to learn some new concepts, but that is part of the fun of programming!

If you are stuck on what to create, ask a software lead for some ideas.

## Instructions

As you should already be in a branch with your name, you can start working on your project.
Create your project starting in the `src/main/kotlin/basics.Unit1/Project-1` directory.

Create any files you need in this directory and add them to git.

When you are done, commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

Then, create a pull request to merge your branch into `main`.
