# Loops

Kotlin has two types of loops: `for` and `while`.

## For Loops

`for` loops are used to iterate through an `array` or `range`.

### What is an array?

An array is a collection of items. Each item in an array has an index. The index of an array starts at 0.

```kotlin
var a = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
println(a[0]) // 1
println(a[1]) // 2
println(a[2]) // 3
```

### What is a range?

A range is a sequence of numbers. A range can be created using the `..` operator.

```kotlin
var a = 1..5
println(a[0]) // 1
println(a[1]) // 2
println(a[2]) // 3
```

### How do I use a for loop?

To use a for loop you specify a variable to be the current item in the array or range, and then you specify the array or range.

```kotlin
var a = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

for (i in a) {
    println(i)
}
```

## While Loops

`while` loops are used to execute a block of code while a condition is true.

```kotlin
var a = 0

while (a < 10) {
    println(a)
    a++
}
```

### Do While Loops

`do while` loops are used to execute a block of code while a condition is true. The difference between a `while` loop and a `do while` loop is that a `do while` loop will always execute the block of code at least once.

```kotlin
var a = 0

do {
    println(a)
    a++
} while (a < 10)
```
