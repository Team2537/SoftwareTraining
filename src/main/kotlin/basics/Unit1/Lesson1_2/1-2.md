# Operators

Operators can be used to (unsurprisingly) preform operations on variables and values.
## Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to preform basic math operations on variables and values.

```kotlin
var a = 10
var b = 5

println(a + b) // 15
println(a - b) // 5
println(a * b) // 50
println(a / b) // 2
println(a % b) // 0
```

## Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

```kotlin
var a = 10
var b = 5

a += b // a = a + b
a -= b // a = a - b
a *= b // a = a * b
a /= b // a = a / b
a %= b // a = a % b
```

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values, and return a Boolean value.
Some examples are:
- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

```kotlin
var a = 10
var b = 5

println(a == b) // false
println(a != b) // true
println(a > b) // true
```

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements, and comparison operators, and return a Boolean value.
Some examples are:
- `&&` And
- `||` Or
- `!` Not

```kotlin
var a = 10
var b = 5
var c = 20
var d = 15

println(a > b && c > d) // false
println(a > b || c > d) // true
println(!(a > b)) // false
```
