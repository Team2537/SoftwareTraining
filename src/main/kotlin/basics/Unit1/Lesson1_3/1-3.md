# Logic Statements

Kotlin contains two types of logic statements: `if` and `when`. Both of these statements are used to control the flow of your program.

## If Statements

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. The `if` statement can be used by itself or with an `else` statement. The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the `if` statement is false.

```kotlin
var a = 10
var b = 5

if (a > b) {
    println("a is greater than b")
} else {
    println("a is not greater than b")
}
```

## When Statements

The `when` statement is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable. The `when` statement can be used by itself or with an `else` statement. The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the `when` statement does not match any of the cases.

```kotlin
var a = 10

when (a) {
    1 -> println("a is 1")
    2 -> println("a is 2")
    3 -> println("a is 3")
    else -> println("a is not 1, 2, or 3")
}
```
