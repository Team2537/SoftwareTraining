/**
 * Lab 1.5: Methods and Constructors
 *
 * Instructions:
 * Create a class called Calculator. It should have methods for each basic arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
 * Each method should take two arguments and return the result of the operation.
 * The class should have a single constructor that takes no arguments.
 * The class should store the last result of an operation in a variable called `lastResult`.
 * lastResult should be set to 0 by default, and public so it can be used for operations.
 *
 * Test the Calculator class by performing several operations and printing the results.
 *
 * Topics: Class, Method, Constructor, Public, Private.
