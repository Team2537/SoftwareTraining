# Constructors

Constructors are used to initialize properties of a class. They are called when an object is created.

## Declaring constructors

Although kotlin has a "primary" constructor, defined with the `init` keyword, 
we try not to use it, as it makes code less readable

Instead, we use a "secondary" constructor, which is defined with the `constructor` keyword.

```kotlin
class Dog {
    constructor() {
        println("A dog has been created")
    }
}
```

## Parameters

Constructors can take parameters, just like functions.
These parameters are used to initialize properties of the class.

```kotlin
class Dog() {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int = 0
    constructor(name: String, age: Int) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }
}
```

## Default values

You can also give parameters default values, so that they don't have to be passed in when the object is created.

```kotlin
class Dog() {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int = 0
    constructor(name: String = "Fido", age: Int = 1) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }
}
```
