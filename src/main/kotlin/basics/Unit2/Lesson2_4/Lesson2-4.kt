    - Create an extension function for the `String` class called `isEmailValid` that returns a `Boolean`
    - The function should check if the string is a valid email address
    - You may check if it's valid however you want, as long as it does end up being valid or invalid when tested
    - Print the result of the function with a valid and invalid email address
