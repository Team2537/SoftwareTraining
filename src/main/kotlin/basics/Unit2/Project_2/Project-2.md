# Unit 2 Project

Good job! You've made it to the end of Unit 2, and by extension,
the end of the Basic Kotlin Training Program. 

To finish off Unit 2, You will be creating a simple project
to test your knowledge of the concepts you learned in this unit.

It is up to you what you would like to create (as long as you clear it with a software lead), but here are some ideas:

- Inventory System
    - A simple system to keep track of items in a store
    - Should be able to add, remove, and update items
    - Should be able to print out the inventory
    - Should be able to search for items
    - Should be able to sort items
- Social Media System
    - A simple system to keep track of users and posts
    - Should be able to add, remove, and update users and posts
    - Should be able to print out the users and posts
    - Should be able to search for users and posts
    - Should be able to sort users and posts
- Geometry Calculator
    - A simple system to calculate the area and perimeter of shapes
    - Should be able to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle, square, rectangle, and triangle
    - Should be able to print out the area and perimeter of each shape, as well as any other relevant information

You may also come up with your own idea, but make sure to clear it with a software lead first.

All of these should be accomplished using all the concepts you've learned, but especially the ones from Unit 2.
