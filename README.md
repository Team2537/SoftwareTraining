# Welcome to FRC 2537's Software Training Program

Our software training repo!

We use [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) for hosting our training so anyone can access it! 

To run the book locally, [install mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) and launch the book with:
```
mdbook serve --open ./book
```

Code exercises for every lesson are in the `src/main/kotlin/` folder in this repo. Enjoy!
