# Training Introduction

This website contains the Software training for Team 2537. Everything you need to know is linked here. 

## Training Schedule
We have about 12 weeks of training. Each week includes two meetings and about 4 hours of meeting time. Specific days and times will be announced by the team captain (Software doesn't choose these times).

### Software Initialization - 1 week

We will go through all of the Kotlin lessons, grouped into 2 units. Each unit will have a project at the end.

### Robot Programming - 4 weeks

You will learn to program a robot and will start to deploy code to a robot and drive it around (this is fun).
