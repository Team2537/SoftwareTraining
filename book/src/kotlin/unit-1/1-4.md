# Classes

Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming. They are a system for organizing and reusing code.
Think of a class as a blueprint for an object. It defines the properties and behaviors of the object, but it is not the
object itself.
When you create an object from a class, you are creating an instance of that class. The object has its own unique
properties and behaviors, but it is based on the blueprint defined by the class.

## Defining a Class

To define a class in Kotlin, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Here is an example of a simple
class definition:

```kotlin
class Person {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int = 0
}
```

In this example, we define a class called `Person` with two properties: `name` and `age`. The properties are defined
using the `var` keyword, which indicates that they are mutable (can be changed). The properties are initialized with
default values of an empty string and zero, respectively.

## Creating Objects

To create an object from a class, you use the class name almost like a function call. Here is an example of creating a
`Person` object:

```kotlin
val person = Person()
```

In this example, we create a `Person` object and assign it to a variable called `person`. The object is created using
the default constructor of the `Person` class, which does not take any arguments. We will learn more about
constructors in the next lesson.

## Properties / Fields

Properties are variables that are associated with an object. They define the state of the object and can be accessed and
modified from outside the class. In the `Person` class, `name` and `age` are properties. These are unique to each
instance of the class. For example, you can create multiple `Person` objects with different names and ages.

### Accessing Properties

You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation. Here is an example of accessing the `name` property
of a `Person` object:

```kotlin
val person = Person()
person.name = "Alice"
println(person.name) // Output: Alice
```

In this example, we create a `Person` object and assign the name "Alice" to the `name` property. We then print the value
of the `name` property using the `println` function.

### Changing Properties

You can change the value of a property by assigning a new value to it. Here is an example of changing the `age`
property of a `Person` object:

```kotlin
val person = Person()
person.age = 30
println(person.age) // Output: 30
```

In this example, we create a `Person` object and assign the age 30 to the `age` property. We then print the value of the
`age` property using the `println` function.

### Getters and Setters

In Kotlin, you can define custom behavior for getting and setting properties using getters and setters. Getters are
methods that are called when you access a property, and setters are methods that are called when you assign a value to a
property.

Here is an example of defining custom getters and setters for the `name` property of the `Person` class:

```kotlin
class Person {
    var name: String = ""
        get() = field.toUpperCase()
        set(value) {
            field = value.trim()
        }
}
```

In this example, we define a custom getter for the `name` property that converts the name to uppercase. We also define a
custom setter that trims leading and trailing whitespace from the name. When you access or assign a value to the `name`
property, the custom getter and setter are called.

### Property Visibility

By default, properties in Kotlin are public, which means they can be accessed and modified from outside the class. You
can also specify the visibility of properties using access modifiers. The available access modifiers are `public`,
`protected`, `private`, and `internal`. But you mainly use `public` and `private`, so we will focus on those.

- `public`: The property is accessible from anywhere.
- `private`: The property is accessible only from within the class.

Both are pretty simple to understand. If you want a property to be accessible from outside the class, you make it
public.
If you want a property to be accessible only from within the class, you make it private.

Here is an example of a private property in the `Person` class:

```kotlin
class Person {
    private var ssn: String = ""
}

fun main() {
    val person = Person()
    // person.ssn = "123-45-6789" // Error: Cannot access 'ssn': it is private in 'Person'
}
```

In this example, we define a private property called `ssn` in the `Person` class. The property is only accessible from
within the `Person` class. If you try to access the `ssn` property from outside the class, you will get a compilation
error.
