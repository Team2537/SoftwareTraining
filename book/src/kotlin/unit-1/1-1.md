# Variables

In Kotlin you can create constant variables with the val keyword.
And you can create non-constant variables with the var keyword.

```kotlin
val a = 1
var b = 2
```

You can also specify the type of the variable using the colon operator.
As seen below, by specifying A and B as integers
```kotlin
val a: Int = 1
var b: Int = 2
```

## Types
What are the basic types in Kotlin?
- `Integer`: A whole number (no decimal)
- `Double`: A number with a decimal
- `Boolean`: True or False
- `String`: A sequence of characters
- `Char`: A single character

Here are some examples of the different types.

```kotlin
val a: Int = 1
val b: Double = 2.0
val c: Boolean = true
val d: String = "Hello World"
val e: Char = 'a'
```

## Type Inference
Kotlin is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.
However, if you do not specify the type of a variable, Kotlin will infer the type for you.
This is called type inference.

```kotlin
val a = 1 // a is an integer
val b = 2.0 // b is a double

println(a::class) // prints "Int"
```

## Nullable Variables
In Kotlin, variables cannot be null (empty) by default.
If you want a variable to be able to be null, you must specify it with a question mark.

```kotlin
val a: Int = null // This will not compile
val b: Int? = null // This will compile
```
