# Kotlin

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a modern programming language that is designed to be fully interoperable with Java. It is a statically-typed language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Team 2537 uses Kotlin for programming the robot.

If you already know Java, you will find Kotlin to be very similar. However, Kotlin has many features that make it more concise and expressive than Java. It also has some features that are not present in Java, such as extension functions and data classes.

In this training, you will receive an introduction to Kotlin and learn about the basics of the language. You will learn about variables, operators, logic statements, loops, functions, classes, objects, and more. You will also complete projects to test your knowledge.

Our goal is to provide you with the resources you need to learn. You will probably need to use these resources on your own time to fully understand the concepts. If you have any questions, feel free to ask a lead or mentor for help.

These lessons are designed to be completed in order. Each lesson builds on the previous one, so it is important to complete them in order. If you miss a meeting or fall behind, you can always catch up by reading the lessons and reading through the linked materials. We will not wait for you during meeting time.

At the end of every lesson, there will be a short exercise for you to complete. The code template for the exercise will be provided, and you will need to fill in the missing parts.
