# Classes and Objects

## Classes

### What is a class?

A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint, or prototype, that defines the variables and the methods (functions) common to all objects of a certain kind.


### Declaring a class

Classes are declared using the keyword `class`:

```kotlin
class MyClass {
    // ...
}
```

You can create an instance of a class like this:

```kotlin
val myObject = MyClass()
```



### Properties

Properties are variables that are stored within an object (class instance). They are declared in the class body, usually at the top:

```kotlin
class MyClass {
    var myProperty: Int = 0
    var myOtherProperty: String = "Hello"
}
```

They can be accessed using the dot notation:

```kotlin
val myObject = MyClass()

myObject.myProperty = 5
println(myObject.myOtherProperty)
```
