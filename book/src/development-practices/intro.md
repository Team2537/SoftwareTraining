# Team 2537 Development Practices Introduction

This document contains the general philosophy that our team has about developing robot code. Programming a competition robot's codebase is fundamentally a collaborative effort, and we have a few guidelines to help make that process as smooth as possible.

These guidelines are divided into two sections:
 - [Code Practices](development-practices/code.md)
 - [Version Control Practices](development-practices/version-control.md)
