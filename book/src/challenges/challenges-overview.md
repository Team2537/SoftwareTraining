# Robot Code Challenges

This section contains a collection of challenges related to programming a robot using WPILib.
These challenges **DO NOT** contain all of the needed information to complete them within their own pages.
Nor do they necessarily only require the information in the previous sections. That's right! You'll need to use your
problem-solving skills to figure out how to complete these challenges.

## Challenge Structure (WIP)

Each challenge will be assigned on a thursday, and will be due for testing the following tuesday. These will be
team-based challenges, usually with 2-3 people per team, although this depends on who is present on the day of the
challenge.

You are required to create a GitHub repository forking off of each challenge's template, and submit a pull request to
the template when you are done. We will then test your code on the robot, and give you feedback on how you did.

Although these challenges will not be "graded" in the traditional sense, the leads AND mentors will be keeping track
of how well you do on these challenges, and will use this information to determine who will be in leadership roles
both during the season, and in future years on the team. So it's important to take them seriously, and put in your
best effort.
